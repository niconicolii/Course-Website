					<h2>2nd Quiz and upcoming lab</h2>
	                <p><span>Posted on: Saturday, March 3, 2018 7:32:47 PM EST</span></p>
					<br>
				    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
				    <p>I will move the 2nd&nbsp;Quiz from 5th March over to 12th March. I am doing this because we have so far just had one lecture on HTML and CSS.&nbsp;I do not think it is fair if I ask you to write a quiz just after one lecture. I want you guys to do well on the quiz, and by having two lectures under our belt, you will be better prepared for the quiz.&nbsp;</p>
				    <p>Also the lab that is coming up, we will explore floats and CSS in greater detail. This will also allow you to get better and apply it on your assignment.&nbsp;</p>

	                <p>Hello everyone,</p> 
					<p>Your midterm exam marks are now available on Blackboard.&nbsp;The class average is 82%!</p> 
					<p>First of all,&nbsp;I must congratulate the class as a whole!&nbsp;You guys have done an amazing job and I am super proud of you. I know for most of you, CS is new and you should be proud that you have put up a commendable effort. The key now is to sustain this until the end of the term. And I am sure you can do this, if you maintain the same level of hard work and dedication!&nbsp;</p> 
					<p>We look at tomorrow introduction to HTML and CSS. We are hoping to have your Assignment1 out by end of the week.&nbsp;</p>
